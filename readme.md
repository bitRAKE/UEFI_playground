Mainly a collection of programming and learning for UEFI.

The examples focus on discovery and exploration of implementations. Every UEFI firmware/shell is a little different as they are built on interpretations the spec.

Working with the latest version of QEMU to debug from Windows.

Also testing on real hardware.
